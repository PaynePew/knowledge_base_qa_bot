"""Shallow module per Ousterhout. Public surface: ``ProdMiddleware``,
``read_sem``, ``admin_sem``, ``rate_limiter``, ``read_saturated``,
``is_provider_quota_error``, ``READ_PATHS``, ``ADMIN_PATHS``.

Production overload + cost-protection middleware for the demo VPS deploy
(issue #269).  One ASGI middleware on the Gateway parent app enforces six
guards, in this order, for every request:

  1. **Admin kill-switch** — if ``KB_ADMIN_TOKEN`` is *set*, admin/mutating
     heavy paths require ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` (401 otherwise).
     Unset (the demo default) → admin paths are open so the Console works
     unauthenticated.  Read paths are never token-gated.
  2. **Daily USD budget** — heavy paths are charged a conservative per-endpoint
     estimate (see ``budget``); once the UTC-day total reaches the relevant
     ceiling they get 503 ``{"detail":"daily demo budget reached"}``. READ_PATHS
     gate on the full ``KB_DAILY_USD_CAP``; ADMIN_PATHS gate on the reduced
     ``KB_DAILY_USD_CAP - KB_READ_RESERVED_USD`` ceiling (issue #598 Slice A),
     so admin/mutating traffic can never spend the read-reserved floor.
     Exception (issue #598 Slice B): an over-cap ``POST /chat/stream?stack=wiki``
     request is NOT 503'd — it is admitted with a ``scope["kb_degraded"]``
     flag and never charged (see ``_can_serve_degraded`` for which paths
     qualify and why).
  3. **Per-IP rate limit** — a fixed-window counter (``KB_RATE_LIMIT_PER_IP``,
     default 30 requests / 5 min per IP; ``0`` disables) over every heavy path,
     read or admin (see ``ratelimit``). Over-limit → 429
     ``{"detail":"rate limited, please retry later"}`` (issue #598 Slice A).
     Runs BEFORE the concurrency gate, mirroring the budget guard's
     charge-after-admission rationale: a rate-limited request never occupies
     a semaphore slot or charges the daily budget.
  4. **Concurrency caps** — a read semaphore (``KB_MAX_INFLIGHT``, default 6)
     over the answer paths and an admin semaphore (``KB_MAX_ADMIN``, default 2)
     over the index/mutate paths.  Over-limit → 503.  The read semaphore's
     saturation is what ``GET /healthz/shed`` reports (``read_saturated()``).
     ``/chat/stream`` additionally passes through a dedicated, tighter SSE cap
     (``KB_SSE_MAX_CONCURRENT`` — see ``gateway/app/sse_capacity.py``, issue
     #599): an SSE connection is held for the FULL stream duration (seconds),
     unlike a normal request/response cycle, so a slow/stalled reader can
     starve capacity even while the general read semaphore still has room.
  5. **Graceful provider failure** — an OpenAI ``insufficient_quota`` / 429
     bubbling out of a *non-streaming* heavy handler is mapped to a friendly
     503 instead of an unhandled 500 / worker crash (the streaming path already
     renders provider errors as a terminal SSE ``error`` event in
     ``gateway/app/routes.py`` — AC5).
  6. **SSE heartbeat + idle-read timeout** — ``/chat/stream`` only (issue
     #599): a ``: ping`` comment frame is injected every
     ``KB_SSE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SEC`` while the downstream generator is
     idle, and any ``send()`` to the client that blocks past
     ``KB_SSE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC`` (no read progress) closes the stream
     server-side. See ``gateway/app/sse_capacity.py`` for the mechanism.

All conditional logic that *decides an answer* lives in the deep stacks; this
module only wires guards around them (CODING_STANDARD §2.3).  Single-worker
model: the semaphores and budget are plain in-process objects (§2.6/§2.7).

Path matching uses the **full mounted path** with any trailing slash stripped
(``/wiki/chat/`` == ``/wiki/chat``).  Four parameterized heavy paths are
canonicalised before classification and charging — an exact-match set
cannot see a per-slug concrete path, and an unclassified path bypasses ALL
guards (the #376 bug class): ``POST /wiki/qa/{slug}/refile`` (ADR-0026
decision 1, issue #380) to ``QA_REFILE_TEMPLATE``, ``DELETE
/wiki/pages/{slug}`` (ADR-0025, issue #381) to ``PAGES_DELETE_TEMPLATE``,
``POST /wiki/pages/{slug}/aliases`` (ADR-0030 decision 3, issue #409) to
``ALIAS_ASSIGN_TEMPLATE``, and ``DELETE /wiki/pages/{slug}/aliases/{alias}``
(ADR-0030 extension, issue #491) to ``ALIAS_REMOVE_TEMPLATE`` — none of the
four call any LLM (Confirmed Remediation / Direct-class assign-alias /
remove-alias, ADR-0024/ADR-0030 Invariants) but each still mutates the live
corpus, so they stay admin-semaphore + kill-switch gated even at a $0.00
budget estimate. ``POST /wiki/qa/promote-batch``
(ADR-0023, issue #382) needs no such canonicalisation — the path carries no
slug — but is classified as ``ADMIN_PATHS`` for the same reason as the
delete path: no LLM call, but a batch of live-corpus mutations plus a BM25
reindex is exactly the kind of write the admin gate exists for.

``GET /wiki/transcribe/jobs/{job_id}`` and ``GET /wiki/transcribe/page-count``
(issue #447) are deliberately left OUT of both sets — each is a read-only,
in-memory or mechanical lookup (job-status poll; PDF page count) with no LLM
call and no corpus mutation, the same rationale that already leaves
``GET /read/*`` and ``GET /healthz*`` unclassified. ``POST
/wiki/transcribe/batch`` is the one that actually starts real (billed) work,
so it — not its poll/preflight siblings — is the path that needs the admin
gate. ``POST /wiki/import/jobs`` / ``GET /wiki/import/jobs/{job_id}``
(issue #497) split identically: the submit starts the same billed work as
``/wiki/import`` and is classified; its poll sibling stays unclassified.

``POST /sources/retire`` / ``POST /sources/restore`` (issue #604, ADR-0041)
mutate the live corpus (a Source file move) with no LLM call, the same
rationale as ``PAGES_DELETE_TEMPLATE`` / the alias endpoints — both are
classified below. Neither is parameterized (the relpath/timestamp travel in
the request body, not the path) so, unlike those two, no canonicalisation
template is needed. ``POST /sources/rename`` (issue #605, ADR-0041 decision
5) is classified for the same reason plus more: a Source-file move AND a
mechanical re-point of every derived page's frontmatter AND a BM25 reindex
— still no LLM call, but the heaviest of the three lifecycle acts, so it
stays admin-semaphore + kill-switch gated exactly like its S1 siblings.
``GET /sources/{relpath}/impact`` and ``GET /sources/trash`` are
deliberately left OUT of both sets: read-only, no LLM, no mutation — the
same rationale that already leaves ``GET /read/*`` and ``GET
/pages/resolution-map`` unclassified.
