"""Deep module per Ousterhout. Public surface: ``delete_full_orphan``, ``PageNotFound``, ``PageCorrupt``, ``PageNotFullOrphan``.

C11 Confirmed Remediation (tier-B S5, issue #381, ADR-0024/0025) — the first
delete of a corpus-resident wiki page. ``DELETE /pages/{slug}`` (routes.py)
wraps ``delete_full_orphan`` (CODING_STANDARD §2.3: all business logic lives
here, the route stays a shallow HTTP<->exception mapper).

Predicate (ADR-0025, the only condition under which a live page may be
deleted): the page is a **full orphan** — its ``sources`` frontmatter is
non-empty and every citation's file is missing under ``docs/**``. This is
recomputed server-side at delete time via ``lint.check_full_orphan`` — the
SAME predicate C11's bulk sweep uses (``lint._orphan_predicate``), so the two
can never disagree. The client's lint finding is never trusted as-is: a
Source may have been restored or re-imported since the report rendered.

Not a general page delete: only ``entities/`` and ``concepts/`` pages
qualify, and only when the full-orphan predicate holds; everything else is
refused (``PageNotFound`` / ``PageNotFullOrphan``). ADR-0012's qa-scoped
"delete inert only, refuse live" rule is left untouched — this is a
different page family (entities/concepts vs qa) with a different lifecycle
(corpus residency vs draft/live status).

Governance: Confirmed Remediation (ADR-0024) — a human confirms the named
irreversible operation; no LLM is involved anywhere in this module; this
module exposes no batch entry point (Confirmed never batches, ADR-0024
Invariant).

Concurrency: the read-predicate-check-delete sequence runs under
``indexer._index_lock`` (mirrors ``reconcile.py``'s apply-time convention),
so a concurrent ``run_lint()`` sweep — which holds the same lock for its
full read pass — never observes a half-deleted page, and the predicate is
re-verified against a state a concurrent ``/ingest`` cannot be mutating.
