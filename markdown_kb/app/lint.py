Lint orchestrator — POST /lint health check for the wiki.

Provides ``run_lint(*, wiki_dir, docs_dir, log_path)`` which orchestrates the
lint checks and writes ``wiki/lint-report.md``.

Slice 5-1 scope
---------------
C11 (orphan pages) is wired.

Slice 5-2 scope
---------------
C3 (failed-grounding sweep) and C4-a (slug collision groups) are added.
Subsequent slices add the remaining checks without changing the orchestrator
contract or the continue-on-error semantics established here.

Slice 5-3 scope
---------------
C6 (mtime-based stale detection) and C2 (red link backlog) are wired.

Slice 5-4 scope
---------------
C1 (coverage gap aggregation from chat_fallback log) is wired.  Reads
``wiki/log.md`` line by line, clusters ``chat_fallback`` and
``chat_grounding_fallback`` entries by reason and canonical query key, and
surfaces the result as a curator-actionable coverage backlog.

Slice 5-5 scope
---------------
C5 (page-pair LLM contradiction detection) is wired.  Uses F1 ∪ F3 candidate
filter before calling the LLM via ``get_lint_llm()`` lazy singleton.
``OPENAI_LINT_MODEL`` env var with 3-layer fallback.  ``temperature=0`` for
determinism.  ``KB_LINT_BM25_TOP_K`` and ``KB_LINT_BM25_THRESHOLD`` control the
F3 filter.  Pairs are symmetrically canonicalised (sorted slug names) so each
pair is judged exactly once.  Continue-on-error: LLM errors mid-batch retain
prior findings.  Cost accounting via response metadata (best-effort token counts).

Slice 6-5 scope (Phase 5 amendment — PRD #78)
---------------------------------------------
Three new read-only checks scan ``wiki/qa/*.md`` and one modifier excludes
``type=qa`` pages from C5 pair generation:

- **C5 modifier** — ``_candidate_pairs`` filters ``frontmatter.type == "qa"``
  BEFORE F1/F3 candidate computation, preserving C5 LLM call budget and
  preventing trivially-true ``duplicate`` findings between qa pages and their
  source entities (PRD #78 Q1 + Q6).
- **C8 promotion candidates** — surfaces ``status: draft`` Filed Answers ranked
  by ``count`` desc / ``updated`` desc to ``lint-report.md`` §
  ``### C8 Promotion Candidates``. Capped by ``KB_LINT_PROMOTION_TOP_N`` env
  var (default 10). Read-only — the actual draft→live mutation is owned by
  Phase 6 ``POST /qa/{slug}/promote``.
- **C9 qa-staleness** — for each ``status: live`` Filed Answer, compares each
  cited entity file's mtime against ``frontmatter.updated``. Newer entities
  surface to ``### C9 Stale Filed Answers``. Closes Q6b "entity re-ingested,
  qa stranded" failure mode.
- **C10 qa-schema-validity** — sweeps ``wiki/qa/`` for invalid frontmatter
  (``status`` outside ``{live, draft, stale, superseded}``, missing/empty
  ``question``, ``type != "qa"``, missing/non-positive ``count``). Surfaces to
  ``### C10 Invalid qa Schema``. Closes Q8d "curator-typo orphan zombie"
  failure mode (third layer of the indexer-log + filing-refuse + lint
  defence stack).

Slice S1 scope (Lint Remediation tier-A — issue #361, ADR-0023)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check. ``LINT_CHECK_TAXONOMY`` maps each of the ten wired checks to a
``{code, label, axis}`` (CONTEXT.md "Lint Axis": Freshness -> Coherence ->
Coverage -> Lifecycle) and ``group_findings_by_axis`` turns a run's
``LintFindings`` into that ordered structure. ``_render_report_markdown``
groups every check section under its axis heading and labels each check
section with its taxonomy code + label, so a later remediation slice (or the
CLI/MCP surfaces, per ADR-0017 interface parity) can reuse the same taxonomy.
Lint remains read-only — this is a report-layout change only.

Slice S3 scope (Lint Remediation tier-A — issue #363, ADR-0023)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check, no new endpoint. ``remediation_for`` maps each of the ten
wired checks to a ``RemediationDescriptor`` (tier + executable actions),
reusing S1's ``LINT_CHECK_TAXONOMY`` codes as keys. The Operator Console is
its first consumer: Direct-tier findings (C6/C3 stale/failed-grounding,
C10 invalid-schema) render a per-row Remediation button wired to the
*existing* ``POST /ingest`` / ``DELETE /qa/{slug}`` endpoints; Authored-tier
findings (C5/C4/C2/C1) render a disabled tier-B affordance; deferred
findings (C9/C11) render neither (no lifecycle endpoint exists yet). Lint
itself is untouched — remediation is always a separate operation triggered
from the report, never a side-effect of ``run_lint()``.

Slice S5 scope (Lint Remediation tier-A — issue #365, ADR-0023)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check, no new endpoint. Each ``LintCheckMeta`` entry in
``LINT_CHECK_TAXONOMY`` gains a ``label_zh`` field (the Traditional-Chinese
short label), and ``LINT_AXIS_LABEL_ZH`` maps each ``LINT_AXIS_ORDER``
identifier to its zh display string. This is the single source of truth for
the Operator Console's zh/en header toggle (structural chrome only — axis
headers, check labels, remediation button verbs, section chrome, empty
states); the dynamic per-finding ``suggested_action`` text stays English.
The axis identifiers themselves (``LINT_AXIS_ORDER`` values, dict keys)
stay English — only their *display* form is bilingual, so the written
report / CLI / MCP renderers (English-only, unchanged by this slice) keep
using the same stable keys.

All four amendments preserve PRD #65 Q3 read-only invariant — they read
frontmatter and write only ``lint-report.md``, never page frontmatter.

Alias core (issue #406, ADR-0030)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A new check, **C12 alias-collision** (Coherence axis; C7 is skipped and
stays unassigned), plus two amendments to existing checks — all sharing the
ONE resolver in ``slugs.build_alias_resolution_map`` (ADR-0030 Invariant:
every wikilink-resolution consumer uses the shared resolver):

- **C2 red-link** now resolves a ``[[wikilink]]`` by slug OR alias before
  calling it red (previously slug-only).
- **``find_inbound_references``** (the C4 merge-apply reference guard) now
  counts an alias-mediated ``[[link]]`` as a real inbound reference.
- **C12 alias-collision** fires on two shapes: an alias colliding with an
  existing page slug, or two pages claiming the same alias. Advisory, Direct
  remediation tier (no executable action yet — the assign-alias endpoint
  that would wire one is a follow-up ticket; this is the foundation slice).

Still read-only — this module never writes the ``aliases`` frontmatter
field itself (that lives in the follow-up assign-alias endpoint); the
preserve-across-re-ingest write path lives in ``ingest.py`` /
``wiki_writer.py``.

C3 display + reason-split suggested_action (issue #407, ADR-0029 decision 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check. ``_check_c3_failed_grounding``'s ``suggested_action`` splits by
``reason`` instead of the previous single undifferentiated template:
``claim_unsupported`` names the recorded ``unsupported_claims`` (an honest
"claims not recorded" note when the list is empty — a defensive/legacy
page) and points at amending the Source, explicitly withholding a bare
Re-ingest recommendation because re-ingesting feeds the same unchanged
Source to the same verifier and fails identically; ``verifier_unavailable``
keeps recommending Re-ingest (a transient failure, not a Source problem).
The Console (``ROW_RENDERERS["C3"]``) and CLI (``_format_c3_failed_grounding``)
now render ``unsupported_claims`` too — the Markdown report already did
(Slice 5-2) — closing the four-surface gap (ADR-0017 parity). Still
read-only.

Slice S1 scope (Lint Remediation tier-B — issue #376, ADR-0028)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check. ``generate_reconcile_draft`` adds a second C5-adjacent LLM
call site (page-pair *drafting*, distinct from ``_judge_page_pair``'s
*judging*) reusing the SAME ``get_lint_llm()`` lazy singleton — kept inside
this module rather than opening a second LLM-facing module for one call
site (ADR-0005 § "LLM-facing surface enumeration" already blesses
``lint.py``'s ``ChatOpenAI`` for "contradiction ... checks"). The actual
disk write-back, hash-based optimistic-concurrency check, and grounding
re-verification live in the new ``reconcile.py`` deep module (writes) —
this module stays read-only with respect to wiki page frontmatter, per the
invariant below; drafting a reconcile is not itself a mutation.

Slice S2 scope (Lint Remediation tier-B — issue #378, ADR-0028)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check. C4's slug-collision groups gain both documented resolutions on
top of S1's two-phase machinery: ``generate_collision_merge_draft`` (merge
every group member into the unsuffixed base slug) and
``generate_collision_differentiate_draft`` (rewrite every group member in
place to be complementary) add a third and fourth C5-adjacent LLM call site,
reusing the SAME ``get_lint_llm()`` lazy singleton. ``find_inbound_references``
is read-only (no LLM call) and scans wiki links + qa citations for a single
slug — the C4 merge-apply reference guard (``reconcile.py``) uses it to
refuse deleting a variant that is still referenced. Disk write-back, hashing,
and grounding re-verification live in ``reconcile.py``, mirroring S1.

Slice S4 scope (Lint Remediation tier-B — issue #380, ADR-0026)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check, no change to this module's checks or report rendering. The
new ``POST /qa/{slug}/refile`` endpoint (chained re-synthesis + grounding-
check + demote-in-place, implemented in ``qa.py``) is C9's remediation, so
``_REMEDIATION_TAXONOMY["C9"]`` flips from ``"deferred"`` to an Authored
descriptor carrying a ``refile`` action — the shared taxonomy this table
already is (S3) now tells every consumer (Console, and any future CLI/MCP
tier label) that C9 is remediable, matching C8's ``page_slug`` target-field
convention. This module has no write path of its own for it: the write,
the LLM-free-vs-LLM-based distinction, and the invariant ("a failed
re-ground writes nothing") all live in ``qa.refile``.

Slice S5 scope (Lint Remediation tier-B — issue #381, ADR-0025)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check. C11's missing-citation scan is refactored into
``_orphan_predicate`` (shared helper) so both ``_check_c11_orphan`` (the bulk
sweep) and the new public ``check_full_orphan`` (the ``DELETE /pages/{slug}``
re-verification entry point, called from the new ``pages.py`` deep module)
compute the SAME full/partial split — ``OrphanPageFinding`` gains a ``full``
field (CONTEXT.md "Orphan Page": every citation missing vs some surviving).
``_REMEDIATION_TAXONOMY["C11"]`` flips from ``"deferred"`` to a Confirmed
descriptor carrying a ``delete`` action — Confirmed sits alongside Direct/
Authored/deferred as a fourth tier value (ADR-0024: a human confirms an
irreversible operation, not curator-drafted content, so it is not Authored).
This module still writes nothing: the delete + reindex live in ``pages.py`` /
``routes.py``, mirroring how ``qa.refile`` owns C9's write path.

Slice S7 scope (Lint Remediation tier-B — issue #383, ADR-0027)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check. C1/C2 flip from Authored to a fourth-and-a-half tier, Routed
(ADR-0027): the fill for a coverage gap or a red link routes through the
existing Upload -> Import -> Ingest pipeline, so no draft ever exists for a
curator to approve — Authored's defining gate would gate nothing.
``_REMEDIATION_TAXONOMY["C1"]`` and ``["C2"]`` move to
``RemediationDescriptor("routed", route="import")`` — ``RemediationDescriptor``
gains a ``route`` field (``None`` for every other tier) so the ONE shared
taxonomy still drives all three surfaces: Console turns the disabled tier-B
placeholder into a real "Fill via Import" navigation control (no execution,
no gate — it commits nothing itself), CLI/MCP render the route as plain text
("fill via: kb import ..."). This module still runs no new check and writes
nothing; the fill itself is entirely the existing Import/Ingest machinery.

Slice S8 scope (Lint Remediation tier-B — issue #384, ADR-0027 decision 2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check, no new state file, no log mutation. ``_check_c1_coverage_gaps``
now also reads plain ``chat`` log entries (retrieval.py's
``_write_chat_log``, written on every completed chat — failing post-LLM asks
included) and suppresses a cluster once a BARE ``chat`` entry for the same
canonical query is newer than the cluster's own newest fallback entry — the
latest ask succeeded. "Bare" is load-bearing: every
``chat_grounding_fallback`` is itself followed by a same-ask ``chat`` entry
microseconds later (retrieval.py logs the fallback then calls
``_write_chat_log`` unconditionally on both post-LLM failure branches), so
each such fallback consumes the next same-query ``chat`` entry and only an
unconsumed one counts as success. A fallback entry logged after a success
re-opens the cluster on the next parse (whole-log reading, no persisted
resolution marker). This sharpens C1's
meaning from "queries that ever failed" to "queries whose latest outcome is
still a failure", and incidentally fixes organic healing: a gap answered by
later content growth stops nagging with no fill required. The report's C1
section gains one explanatory line so a disappearing cluster reads as
"latest ask succeeded", not as a mystery or a log-rotation artefact. The
Console pairs this with a user-triggered "Verify: re-ask" control (one
``POST /chat`` with a sample query) that both proves closure to the human
and writes the resolving ``chat`` entry this check reads.

Slice scope (Lint Remediation tier-B — issue #408, ADR-0029 decisions 2-4)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check. C3 is the first finding carrying **two** remediation classes at
once: its executable Direct ``reingest_retry`` action stays wired unchanged
(``verifier_unavailable`` is a transient failure Re-ingest genuinely fixes),
but ``claim_unsupported`` — C3's dominant failure mode — has no mechanical
fix at all: the missing ingredient (what the Source *should* say) is
knowledge only the human can supply, exactly the Routed definition
(ADR-0027). Rather than repurpose the ``route`` field (which every existing
consumer, including a pre-existing unit test, reads as "this check's ONE
tier is Routed"), ``RemediationDescriptor`` gains a SEPARATE
``secondary_route`` field so a check can carry an additional Routed
navigation on top of its primary tier without ambiguity: C3 stays
``tier="direct"`` (the Direct action is still real and still wired) and
``secondary_route="fix-source"`` names the navigation the Console's "Fix
Source" control, ``kb lint``, and ``kb_lint_v1`` all read off this SAME
shared taxonomy value (ADR-0017 parity) — commits nothing itself, mirroring
the C1/C2 Routed Invariant.

Slice scope (issue #446 — C5 content-hash verdict cache)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
No new check. C5 verdicts are a pure function of the two judged pages'
*content* (frontmatter is irrelevant to the LLM's judgement), so
``_check_c5_page_pair`` now keys each verdict on the SHA-256 hash of each
page's body (the same frontmatter-stripped text ``_load_wiki_pages`` already
produces) rather than re-judging every candidate pair on every audit. A
cache hit reuses the stored ``PagePairFinding`` verbatim (remapped onto the
current slug pair) with zero LLM calls; a page whose body is unchanged since
the last audit therefore never re-costs a call, while editing either page of
a pair changes that page's hash and re-judges only the pairs containing it —
every other cached pair is untouched. The cache lives at
``.kb/c5_verdict_cache.json`` (``_c5_verdict_cache_path``), colocated with
the other runtime KB state (``.kb/index.json``); like that state it is
gitignored and ephemeral — a missing file is a cold-start cache miss, never
an error, and it repopulates from scratch on the next audit after a
``.kb/`` reset. A corrupt (unparseable / non-object) cache file DOES raise
(CODING_STANDARD §4.1 fail-fast on persistent-state corruption), but that
raise is caught by ``run_lint``'s existing per-check continue-on-error
wrapper — exactly like a C5 LLM outage — so a bad cache file degrades to
"C5 skipped this run, recorded in ``check_errors['c5']``", never a full
lint failure or a silently-wrong read. An individual STALE cache entry
(e.g. left over from a since-changed ``PagePairFinding`` schema) is instead
treated as an ordinary cache miss — re-judging one pair is a safe degrade
with the exact same outcome as a cold cache, so one incompatible entry
cannot poison every other cached verdict. The cache is rebuilt fresh each
run from exactly the pairs judged this run (hits and misses alike); pairs
that fall out of candidacy are dropped rather than accumulating forever.
Metrics: ``_c5_cache_hit_counter`` (reused verdicts, zero LLM calls) joins
the existing ``_c5_llm_call_counter``, which now counts only actual cache
*misses* — so ``LintSummary.cost_usd`` reflects real spend, not the
pre-cache count of every judged pair. Both are surfaced in the
``lint_completed`` log line (visible cache hit/miss + cost accounting, per
the issue's AC) without extending ``LintSummary`` or any CLI/MCP/Console
renderer — out of this slice's scope, per its AC wording ("visible in
logs").

Slice scope (issue #473 — C5 verdict cache generation salt)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Fixes a correctness regression in the #446 cache above: a C5 verdict is
**not** a pure function of page content — it is also a function of the
resolved judge model (``OPENAI_LINT_MODEL`` → ``OPENAI_MODEL`` →
``"gpt-4o-mini"``) and ``_C5_SYSTEM_PROMPT``, neither of which was part of
the cache key. ``_c5_generation_salt()`` hashes both of those (plus a
cache-format version int) into a single salt that ``_check_c5_page_pair``
prefixes onto every stored/looked-up key. A model swap or a prompt edit
therefore makes every existing entry an on-disk key miss — a cold re-judge,
not a silent cost=0 stale hit — with no explicit migration step, since the
cache file is already rewritten each run from only that run's judged pairs
(the orphaned old-salt entries are simply not carried forward). Same
content + same model + same prompt still hits the cache unchanged, so the
#446 cost win is preserved.

Slice scope (issue #483 — lint LLM singleton rebuilds on model change)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Closes a gap #473 left open (flagged non-blocking by the independent Verdict
agent on PR #480): ``get_lint_llm()``'s lazy singleton was never rebuilt once
constructed, so an in-process ``OPENAI_LINT_MODEL`` change (no process
restart) still salted the on-disk cache key with the NEW model (correctly
forcing a re-judge, per #473) while ``_judge_page_pair`` kept calling the
OLD model's cached client — the fresh verdict landed under the new salt but
was actually computed by the stale model. ``get_lint_llm`` now tracks the
resolved model name (``_lint_llm_model``) it built the singleton with and
rebuilds whenever ``_resolve_lint_model_name()`` no longer matches, so the
client and the salt can never drift apart. The normal env-change → restart
deploy flow is unaffected (both start ``None``, one construction either
way) and steady-state (model unchanged) still makes zero extra client
constructions.

Read-only invariant
-------------------
``run_lint()`` does NOT modify wiki page frontmatter.  It writes:
  - ``wiki/lint-report.md``        (Generated index artifact, gitignored)
  - ``wiki/log.md``                (Runtime trace, append-only)
  - ``.kb/c5_verdict_cache.json``  (C5 verdict cache, ephemeral, gitignored — issue #446)

Concurrency
-----------
``run_lint()`` holds ``indexer._index_lock`` for the full duration so a
concurrent ``/ingest`` (which also holds the lock) cannot produce mid-write
state for lint to observe.  ``/chat`` reads are not blocked.

Continue-on-error
-----------------
If a check raises, the exception is caught, a ``lint_check_error`` log entry is
written, and the error is recorded in ``LintResponse.check_errors``.  Other
checks still run.  The report is always written.

Check execution order (cheapest to most expensive)
---------------------------------------------------
1. C11 orphan (read frontmatter only)
2. C3 failed-grounding (read frontmatter only)
3. C4-a slug collision (filename list only)
4. C12 alias-collision (read frontmatter only)
5. C6 stale pages (stat docs/ files)
6. C2 red links (scan wiki page bodies)
7. C1 coverage gap (read log.md only)
8. C8 promotion candidates (read qa frontmatter)
9. C9 qa-staleness (stat entity files vs qa updated)
10. C10 qa-schema-validity (read qa frontmatter)
11. C5 page-pair LLM (F1∪F3 filter + LLM) — most expensive last

        SAME alias and no real page owns that slug. The shared resolver's
        tie-break (lexicographically-first canonical slug) decides which
        page currently "wins" that alias; the other claimant(s) silently
        never resolve via it.

    Algorithm:
    1. Collect every real page slug from ``entities/`` and ``concepts/``.
    2. Collect every ``(alias, declaring_slug)`` pair from each page's
       frontmatter ``aliases`` list.
    3. Group declarations by alias. An alias with a single declarer AND no
       real-slug collision resolves cleanly — not a finding.
    4. Emit one finding per alias that collides either way, sorted
       alphabetically by ``alias``.

    Read-only — mirrors every other lint check's frontmatter-scan contract
    (PRD #65 Q3 invariant); this check never edits frontmatter.

    A wiki page is *stale* when:
    - ``frontmatter.source_hashes`` contains an entry for the Source file, AND
    - The stored ``docs_body`` SHA-256 hash differs from the current file content's hash.

    Pages with no ``source_hashes`` frontmatter (legacy Phase 6 pages, drift state unknown)
    are skipped rather than generating false positives. Pages whose Source file does NOT
    exist are handled by C11 (orphan check). C6 explicitly skips them.

    Hash comparison is stable across ``git clone``/checkout — unlike mtime, the
    SHA-256 of file content does not change when the working tree is reconstructed from
    the same commit. ``source_mtime`` and ``page_updated`` are still read for display
    purposes in the emitted finding.

    Algorithm:
    1. For each wiki page in ``entities/`` and ``concepts/``:
       a. Parse frontmatter; skip if no sources or no source_hashes.
       b. Take ``sources[0]``; strip ``#anchor`` to get the Source filename.

    to the per-reason cluster key table in issue #69:

    - ``retrieval_empty``: key = ``_canonicalise(q)``
    - ``below_threshold``: key = ``(_canonicalise(q), top_section)``
    - ``claim_unsupported``: key = ``(_canonicalise(q), tuple(sorted(cited_pages)))``
    - ``wiki_layer_empty``: skipped entirely (filtered by kind, not reason)

    Env var ``KB_LINT_MIN_HITS`` (default 1): clusters with ``hit_count <
    KB_LINT_MIN_HITS`` are excluded from the returned list.  Read at function
    entry (not at module load) to mirror the ``KB_SCORE_THRESHOLD`` pattern.

    Latest-outcome resolution (ADR-0027 decision 2, tier-B S8, issue #384):
    a cluster is **suppressed** (excluded from the returned list) when a
    BARE ``chat`` log entry (retrieval.py's ``_write_chat_log``) for the
    SAME canonical query is newer than the cluster's own newest fallback
    entry — the latest ask for that query succeeded, whether via a
    curator's fill or organic content growth. Pairing rule: the producer
    writes a ``chat`` entry on EVERY completed chat, failing post-LLM asks
    included (both grounding-failure branches log
    ``chat_grounding_fallback`` then call ``_write_chat_log``
    unconditionally), so each ``chat_grounding_fallback`` consumes the next
    same-query ``chat`` entry and only an unconsumed ("bare") one is a
    success signal. A fallback entry newer than that success re-opens the
    cluster on the next parse (no state is persisted between runs; this
    re-derives from the whole log every time, per the read-only invariant).
    This changes C1's meaning from "queries that ever failed" to "queries
    whose latest outcome is still a failure".

    Counter semantics:
    - ``malformed_lines``: lines that are in a C1 kind but whose structure
      could not be parsed (missing query field, regex non-match, parse exception).
      If ``malformed_lines > 0`` a ``lint_check_error`` is written.
    - ``out_of_scope_reasons``: lines parsed cleanly but whose ``reason=`` value
      is not one C1 handles (e.g. ``not_indexed``, ``verifier_unavailable``).
      These are silently ignored — they are legitimately not C1's concern.

    Returns findings sorted:
    - Primary: fixed group order (``retrieval_empty``, ``below_threshold``,
      ``claim_unsupported``)
    - Within group: ``hit_count`` descending; ties broken alphabetically by
      ``query_canonical``

    PRD #78 Phase 5 amendment §"C9 — qa-staleness". Read-only — surfaced to
    ``lint-report.md`` §``## Stale Filed Answers``. Closes Q6b "entity
    re-ingested, qa stranded" failure mode.

    Staleness is detected by comparing the entity page's ``frontmatter.updated``
    timestamp against the qa page's ``frontmatter.updated`` timestamp.  This is
    stable across ``git clone``/checkout because both timestamps come from file
    *content*, not filesystem metadata.  When an entity is re-ingested, ``/ingest``
    writes a new ``updated`` value into the entity frontmatter, which advances the
    timestamp and triggers this check.

    Algorithm:
    1. For each ``wiki/qa/*.md`` with ``frontmatter.status == "live"``:
       a. Parse ``frontmatter.sources``; for each citation
          ``"<entity-slug>#<heading-slug>"`` extract the bare entity slug.
       b. For each entity slug, locate the entity file: try
          ``wiki/entities/<slug>.md`` first, then ``wiki/concepts/<slug>.md``.
       c. Parse the entity page's ``frontmatter.updated`` as a UTC datetime.
          If entity_updated > qa.frontmatter.updated, the citation is "stale".
       d. If at least one citation is stale, emit a QaStalenessFinding with
          all stale citations and the max drift in days.
    2. Return findings sorted by ``max_drift_days`` desc, then slug asc.

    one, and every ``"deferred"`` one — tier alone drives a Direct-only
    consumer's disabled tier-B affordance (Authored), a navigation control
    (Routed), or "no control yet" rendering (deferred). C9 is the one
    Authored exception (tier-B S4, issue #380, ADR-0026): its ``refile``
    action carries a real one-click-to-open remediation (the human gate is
    the downstream Promote, not a preview step here) — see the C9 entry in
    ``_REMEDIATION_TAXONOMY`` below. C11 is the one Confirmed check with an
    action (tier-B S5, issue #381, ADR-0024/0025): its ``delete`` action
    opens a confirmation naming the operation, not a draft-review —
    Confirmed's human gate is "confirm this happens", never "approve this
    content". ``route`` is set only for Routed checks (C1/C2, tier-B S7,
    issue #383, ADR-0027) — it names the existing workflow the finding's
    fill navigates to (currently always ``"import"``); every other tier
    leaves it ``None``. Routed has no gate and no action to execute: the
    affordance it drives is pure navigation, so a consumer never mistakes it
    for something it could batch or approve.

    ``secondary_route`` (issue #408, ADR-0029) is the one field a check sets
    when it belongs to TWO remediation classes at once instead of one —
    today only C3: its primary tier stays ``"direct"`` (the executable
    ``reingest_retry`` action is unaffected), but ``claim_unsupported``'s
    real fix — amending what the Source says — is knowledge only the human
    can supply, so C3 ALSO carries a Routed navigation alongside its Direct
    action. Kept as a field distinct from ``route`` (rather than reusing it)
    so ``route`` stays the unambiguous "this check's ONE tier IS Routed"
    signal for every existing C1/C2-only consumer; ``None`` for every check
    that is not C3.

# code -> RemediationDescriptor. Direct-tier actions wire to the *existing*

# POST /ingest, C10 -> DELETE /qa/{slug}, C8 -> POST /qa/{slug}/promote +
# DELETE /qa/{slug} (rendered by the Curation Queue block, not per-row lint
# buttons — issue #363 AC "C8 promotion controls remain in the dedicated
# Curation Queue block, unchanged"). Authored-tier checks C5/C4 get an empty
# ``actions`` tuple: visible under their axis, never one-click actionable —
# Authored Remediation always has a curator approval gate (ADR-0023) that
# these two checks surface as a preview/edit/apply step (reconcile/collision,
# ADR-0028). C9 is Authored WITH an action (tier-B S4, issue #380, ADR-0026
# decision 1): its own gate is the *downstream* Promote step on the
# resulting draft, not a preview here, so ``refile`` wires directly like a
# Direct action even though the check stays Authored-classified (the
# additive synthesis half is what classifies it — see ADR-0026). C11 orphan
# is ``"confirmed"`` (tier-B S5, issue #381, ADR-0024/0025): a human confirms
# the named irreversible ``DELETE /pages/{slug}`` operation, not curator-
# drafted content, so it is a fourth tier value rather than shoehorned into
# Authored — Confirmed involves no LLM call anywhere and never batches
# (ADR-0024 Invariant). The action wires unconditionally here; the per-finding
# full/partial eligibility (``OrphanPageFinding.full``) is what a consumer
# reads to decide whether to render the delete button or advisory text only.
# C1/C2 are ``"routed"`` (tier-B S7, issue #383, ADR-0027): fill routes
# through the existing Upload -> Import -> Ingest pipeline, so no draft ever
# exists for a curator to approve — Authored's gate would gate nothing.
# Routed carries no action (there is nothing to execute, only to navigate
# to) but DOES carry ``route`` — the one field a Routed descriptor sets — so
# every surface can render the SAME navigation hint off the one shared
# taxonomy (Console: a real "Fill via Import" control; CLI/MCP: the route as
# text). ADR-0027 Invariant: a Routed remediation commits nothing itself.
# C12 alias-collision (issue #406, ADR-0030) is ``"direct"`` — the fix is a
# hand-edit of frontmatter, no LLM, no synthesis, reversible — but carries
# NO action yet: the endpoint that would execute it (``POST
# /pages/{slug}/aliases`` assign-alias, or a future frontmatter-edit route)
# is explicitly out of scope for this foundation slice (issue #406 "no HTTP
# surface, no UI"). A follow-up slice adds the real ``RemediationAction``
# once that endpoint exists — until then this entry only classifies the
# tier and supplies the zh/en label via the shared taxonomy.
# C3 (issue #408, ADR-0029 decisions 2-4) is the first entry carrying TWO
# remediation classes: it stays ``"direct"`` (the ``reingest_retry`` action
# below is unaffected — ``verifier_unavailable`` is a transient failure
# Re-ingest genuinely fixes) AND sets ``secondary_route="fix-source"`` — for
# ``claim_unsupported``, the real fix (what the Source should say) is
# knowledge only the human can supply, exactly the Routed definition
# (ADR-0027), so the Console's "Fix Source" control, ``kb lint``, and
# ``kb_lint_v1`` all navigate to the SAME existing Upload -> Re-ingest ->
# Lint machinery this taxonomy already names elsewhere, per finding — it
# commits nothing itself (ADR-0029 Invariant).
