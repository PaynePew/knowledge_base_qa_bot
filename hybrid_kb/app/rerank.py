"""Deep module per Ousterhout. Public surface: ``rerank``, ``get_cross_encoder``, ``is_enabled``, ``RERANK_ENABLED_ENV``, ``RERANK_MODEL``, ``DEFAULT_RERANK_DEPTH``.

Hybrid Retrieval (Stack C) — cross-encoder **reranker** (ADR-0019 / #310).

The *precision* step ADR-0018 deferred. RRF is a recall-union step that rescues a
relevant Section one method ranked low; the reranker is the orthogonal precision
step that re-scores the fused candidate pool with a **cross-encoder** — query and
Section scored *jointly* in one model pass, unlike the dense arm's separate
bi-encoder similarity — and reorders it before the final ``top_k`` cut. The two
compose; the reranker does NOT replace RRF.

Two hard constraints shape this module (ADR-0019):

  * **Default-OFF.** ``KB_HYBRID_RERANK`` gates the whole stage; it is read THROUGH
    this module at call time (``is_enabled``) so a test / the eval can toggle it
    via the environment, mirroring the ``KB_SCORE_THRESHOLD`` /
    ``KB_RAG_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD`` pattern. With the flag off, nothing here runs.

  * **Never loaded on the VPS tenant.** The cross-encoder (``bge-reranker-v2-m3``,
    ~2.3 GB, multilingual incl. Chinese) and its ``sentence-transformers`` / torch
    dependency are an OPTIONAL group (``uv sync --group rerank``) that the slim
    production image never installs. The import therefore lives LAZILY inside
    ``get_cross_encoder`` (never at module import), so importing ``hybrid_kb`` with
    the flag off needs no torch, and enabling the flag without the dep fails fast
    with an actionable message rather than a raw ImportError.

The reranker is pure reordering: it never mints, mutates, or drops Section
content (1:1 id alignment + ``CitableContent`` preserved), its score is never
surfaced as a citation score and never feeds the Cannot-Confirm OR-gate (which
stays on each arm's native pre-fusion score, upstream of fusion) — ADR-0018/0019.
